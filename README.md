# CarND-Project3-BehavioralCloning

## Introduction
###This project is to perform Behavioral Cloning of human driving behavior. Images obtained from human driving are used to train a deep neural network. The trained model then is used for self-driving. The whole process of data collection and self-driving testing is done through Udacity Simulator.
